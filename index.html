        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used to define how a webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS defines colours, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage with CSS: Inline, Internal CSS style sheet and External CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations will apply.</li>
          <li>The declarations contain two important elements: the CSS property we want to apply, and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>CSS box model includes Margin, Border, Padding, and Content.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Using an asterisk (*) creates a selector that applies the rules to all the visible elements on a webpage.</li>
          <li>You can combine two selectors by using a comma (,), which avoids repetition for sections where the same rules apply.</li>
          <li>Class Attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>Class Attributes can then be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>We can assign a class selector by adding a period (.) before the name of the selector.</li>
        </ul>
