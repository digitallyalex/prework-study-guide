# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for bootcamp students who were going through the Prework section, so they could keep track of the main points learnt about HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript in handy bulletpoint notes.

It was built because bootcamp students face an overwhelming amount of information to learn at the beginning, so having all the notes in one place can be helpful.

Through this project, I learnt how HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript work together in order to create web applications, an important base knowledge that I know will help me throughout the rest of the bootcamp.

## Usage

Each section on this webpage contains notes about the main topics Bootcamp students will learn about in the prework stage, including HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.

Open the DevTools Console by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). On the right hand side of the page, a console panel should open where we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and recommend one topic to study first.
